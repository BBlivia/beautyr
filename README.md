Hello, this the MVP for my app, "Beauty Review" 
Users can upload pictures, and give a review on a stylist or makeup artist. I created this app because I love getting dolled up, but after getting scammed by Ig hair stylists I decided to create a space  that would allow clients to properly vet their stylists and makeup artists before dishing out money.
In addition to leaving a review users can like and comment on reviews.

I learned alot, doing this project. I am so proud of myself for figuring out how to search an index!


# Beauty Review
This a full stack 'passion project' of mine! Beauty Review provides a safe place for users to review the services they have received from hair stylists and makeup artists. Users can tag their general location, upload pictures along with their experiences, while also being able to view, like and leave comments on other users posts. Lastly they can search reviews on a stylist or artist, by inputting said stylist or artist's instagram handle. The current landscape of the beauty service industry has made it very difficult for paying customers to find and trust the work, of stylists and artists, Beauty Review seeks to remedy this problem. With Beauty Review the days of paying high deposits, late cancellations, late start time, and overall bad customer service will lower in frequenct!!!

# How It's Made
Tech used: JavaScript, Tailwind, EJS, Node, Passport Auth, Express, and Mongodb 
  - I built the app using the MVC Architecture and implemented authorization through passport local. This full-stack web application uses   CRUD functionalities.
  - The back end of this app was created using Node.js, Express, and Ejs. I decided to use EJS due to its combination of HTML and Js. 
  - The front end was created using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, DaisyUI, and JavaScript. 
  -  Lastly, MongoDB is being used to store all the posts, comments, and users, data. I decided to use a NoSQL database like MongoDB because of its object (key: value) pair databases, which work the same as Javascript objects
# Optimizations
The app is at a working build however in the future I plan on adding

- I'm still deciding on if I want to keep users semi anonymous by not adding a profile picture, however once I decide yes, then I will implement that into the app 
- I also would like to add a feature that allows stylists and artists to advertise their services, and for customers to book on the website
- Additionally I would like to add a star rating system for customers to rate their service provider, and for said rating to show up once a user searches the name of the stylist or artist


# Lessons Learned
  - I learned how to user Mongodb's search index, which i must say is the thing Im most proud of!!!!
  - I also strengthened my knowledge of tialwind!!
